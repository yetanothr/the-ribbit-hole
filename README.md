## Welcome to my imagination

The Ribbit Hole is a project made to shock, inspire and make you question your perception of reality.
It's a way for me to practice programming, learn new things, it's a creative outlet and my portfolio.

## Inspirations

Main purpose of this section is to present the source material I took inspiration from and credit the authors of art used.
It may also present some thougts I have on certain sections of the project.

# The night sky background

I've dreamt of creating such effect in JS for a bit now. It's not perfect, in fact it's quite rudimentary.
I plan on improving the way the stars look, are spread out and on offsetting their blinking.
I still love the effect, though.
